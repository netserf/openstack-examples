Some helpful examples and usage of OpenStack technologies that I've been playing with.

## GENERAL

[OpenStack Client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/) - Notes on how to use the OpenStack command line client.
[OpenStack Client Install](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html) - Notes on how to install python openstack client tools.

## HEAT
[Single VM Example](heat-templates/single-vm.yml) - An example of how to instantiate a single VM in a pre-existing OpenStack network. This isn't ideal for reuse since the parameters need to be replaced for the OpenStack environment, but its an easy starting point.
